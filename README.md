## CODE SIGNING

- When you install this app it will say that SmartScreen is protecting your computer. That is because the code is not signed. This is a $270/year fee that I do not want to spend on such a pet project.

- Do not install any other copies of this application unless it is known to have been downloaded directly from this repository.

- To continue with the installation click on the "More Info" link and proceed anyways.

## What this application does

This app has been made for Joey of the Joey Does Tech YouTube channel. This app serves as a local repository of profit and loss tracking as well as time tracking.

All data is saved locally and does not require an internet connection to function

> Note: This application does utilize the Iconify and Google Fonts API. If you are not connected to the internet, the font will be set to your system font and icons will not display. The app will still function, but it just won't be as pretty.
