## CODE SIGNING

- When you install this app it will say that SmartScreen is protecting your computer. That is because the code is not signed. This is a $270/year fee that I do not want to spend on such a pet project.

- Do not install any other copies of this application unless it is know to have been downloaded directly from this repository.

- To continue with the installation click on the "More Info" link and proceed anyways.
